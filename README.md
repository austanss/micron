# microCORE

microCORE is the kernel powering microNET.

# About
## Use Case
microCORE is designed uniquely, as a kernel, to be as small, performant, secure, and stable as possible, to run on embedded devices which lack power or memory, for extended periods of time.

## Stable
microCORE has been designed to be stable. We are adding more features for stability, but at the time, these include:

    - complete position-independence

## Secure
microCORE has security as a #3 priority, but at the moment we have no features to provide for this.

## Speedy
microCORE is compiled, at release target, with maximum optimizations. More features are to come.

## Small
microCORE is optimized to the fullest extent so that the kernel has minimal components, for modularity, and size.

Compare this to the Linux kernel, which is 80MB **at compressed size**, or the NT kernel (as of Windows 7), which is 25MB.
