# micron

# About
## Use Case
micron is designed uniquely, as an operating system, to be as small, performant, secure, and stable as possible, to run on embedded devices which lack power or memory, for extended periods of time.

## Stable
micron has been designed to be stable. We are adding more features for stability, but at the time, these include:

    - strong code quality standards
    - higher half mapping, safe for programs

## Secure
micron has been designed to be secure. We are adding more features for security, but at the time, these include:

    - higher half mapping, mitigating older designs for kernel reading

## Speedy
micron is compiled, at release target, with maximum optimizations. More features are to come.

## Small
micron is optimized to the fullest extent so that the kernel has minimal components, for modularity, and size.

Compare this to the Linux kernel, which is 80MB **at compressed size**, or the NT kernel (as of Windows 7), which is 25MB.
